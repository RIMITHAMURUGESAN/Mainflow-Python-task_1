## Introduction
This project demonstrates solutions to various Python programming tasks. The goal was to solve problems efficiently, handle edge cases, and write clean, well-documented code. The tasks ranged from basic arithmetic operations to more complex algorithms like the Fibonacci sequence and a custom encryption-decryption system.

## Implementation Details

### The Sum of Two Numbers
- **Objective**: Calculate the sum of two integers.
- **Approach**: The sum of two integers is calculated using the `+` operator.

### Odd or Even
- **Objective**: Determine if a number is odd or even.
- **Approach**: The modulo operator `%` is used to check if a number is divisible by 2.

### Factorial Calculation
- **Objective**: Compute the factorial of a number.
- **Approach**: A loop is used to compute the factorial of a number.

### Fibonacci Sequence
- **Objective**: Generate the first `n` numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.
- **Approach**: A loop generates the Fibonacci sequence up to `n` numbers.

### Reverse a String
- **Objective**: Reverse the characters in a string.
- **Approach**: The string is reversed using Python's slicing feature (`[::-1]`).

### Palindrome Check
- **Objective**: Check if a string reads the same backward as forward.
- **Approach**: The string is compared with its reversed version to check if it is a palindrome.

### Leap Year Check
- **Objective**: Determine if a year is a leap year.
- **Approach**: A year is checked for being a leap year using the rules: divisible by 4 but not by 100, unless also divisible by 400.

### Armstrong Number
- **Objective**: Check if a number equals the sum of its digits raised to the power of the number of digits.
- **Approach**: The number is checked to see if it equals the sum of its digits raised to the power of the number of digits.

### Custom Encryption-Decryption System (Caesar Cipher)
- **Objective**: Implement a custom encryption-decryption system using the Caesar Cipher.
- **Approach**: A Caesar Cipher is implemented, where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. The decryption function reverses the shift.

## Challenges
- **Handling Edge Cases**: Tasks like the **Leap Year Check** and **Armstrong Number** required careful handling of edge cases, such as negative numbers or special characters.
- **Algorithm Design for Encryption**: Designing the **Caesar Cipher** required handling uppercase and lowercase letters, as well as non-alphabetic characters.
- **Time Management**: Completing all tasks within the 7-day deadline required effective time management and prioritization.

## Conclusion
All tasks were successfully implemented and tested for correctness. The project reinforced fundamental programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, and string manipulation. Additionally, the custom encryption-decryption system provided insights into algorithm design and data security principles.
